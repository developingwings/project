<h4><u>Why Goodreads?</u></h4>
<p> I've been using <em>Goodreads</em>  for a long time now as I find it to be a really practical, user-friendly virtual library. It gives the possibility to organise titles according to preferences and to plan ahead, as one may also create a wishlist. Every book has a brief description and reviews from other users, so you can get a taste of it before taking on the journey.</p>
